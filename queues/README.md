## Queues

A **queue** is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data in sequential, FIFO (first-in, first-out) order.

A queue has two principal operations:

* **enqueue** - add an element to the collection
* **dequeue** - remove the oldest element

### Time Complexity

|        | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ------ | :----------: | :--------: |
| Access |    `O(n)`    |   `O(n)`   |
| Insert |    `O(1)`    |   `O(1)`   |
| Delete |    `O(1)`    |   `O(1)`   |
| Search |    `O(n)`    |   `O(n)`   |

### Examples

* Ticketing line
* Event Loop
