# Linked Lists

A **linked list** is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of linked nodes, where each node contains a pointer to the next node in sequence.

* **Singly-Linked** - each node points to next node, last node points to null
* **Doubly-Linked** - each node contains two pointers that point to next node and previous node, last node points to null

### Time Complexity

* Access: `O(n)`
* Search: `O(n)`
* Insertion: `O(1)`
* Deletion: `O(1)`
